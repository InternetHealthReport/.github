<h1 align="center">Internet Health Report</h1>
<p align="center">
The Internet Health Report monitors the conditions of networks that compose the Internet. This effort aims to provide network operators, policymakers, and other stakeholders, with a better understanding of the Internet's infrastructure and its evolution.

# Terminologies

 <tr>
   <!-- Network dependency -->
   <td width=500px><h2 align="center">AS Dependency</h3><p align="center"> Networks connected to the Internet inherently rely on other networks to reach the rest of the world. The Internet Health Report quantifies the inter-dependency of networks using global routing information (BGP), hence improving our understanding of networks connectivity and resiliency.Learn more about <a href="https://ihr.iijlab.net/ihr/en-us/documentation#AS_dependency">AS Dependency</a>
   </td>
  
  <!-- Network Delay -->
   <td width=500px><h2 align="center">Network Delay</h3><p align="center">Delay is a key metric when assessing the performance or conditions of a network. The Internet Health Report infers network delays between ASes, cities, and Internet landmarks from traceroute data.

  <!-- Service Mesh Performance -->
 <td width=500px><h2 align="center"> Link Monitoring</h3><p align="center">Network congestion is another key indicator of network conditions. The Internet Health Report pinpoints link congestion and abnormal forwarding patterns using traceroute data.

</td>
  <!-- Service Mesh Patterns -->
   <td width=500px><h2 align="center"> Disconnection</h3><p align="center">The worst-case scenario is the complete disconnection of a network from the Internet. The Internet Health Report infers data plane disruptions by monitoring the connectivity of RIPE Atlas probes.Learn more about <a href="https://ihr.iijlab.net/ihr/en-us/documentation#Network_disconnections">Disconnection</td>
